# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION
Performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset. Deal with imbalanced dataset using techniques like Smote, Near miss and Cluster Based Oversampling, Random Over and Under Sampler.
selected the machine learning models Logistic Regression and Decision tree calssifier  to predict whether given
card is fraudulent or not.
Tested the accuracy with the help of confusion matrix and got 99% accurate.
Also used deep neural networks to predict the target and checkthe accuarcy which gives 99.93 % accuracy.
